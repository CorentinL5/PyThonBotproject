# PyThonBotproject

PyThonBotproject is a small Python project created for fun, with the aim of learning how to use the discord.py library to create Discord bots.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to install the discord.py library. You can do this by executing the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install discord
```

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure you also have a `token.txt` file containing the token for your Discord bot.

## Configuration

1. **Install Dependencies:** Run `pip install -r assets/requirements.txt` to install all necessary dependencies.

2. **Get a Discord Token:** Visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to create a new application.
<br>Then, add a bot to this application and **copy the generated token**.
   
3. **Create a `token.txt` File:** Create the file in the [`assets/`](assets/) directory of your project and paste the Discord bot token there.

## Usage

1. **Run the Bot:** Use your terminal to navigate to the directory containing the main Python file of your bot. Then, execute the following command: 

```
python bot.py
```

2. **Invite the Bot to Your Discord Server:** Use the invitation link generated by the Discord Developer interface to add your bot to your Discord server.
